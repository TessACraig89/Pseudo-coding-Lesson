# Psuedo Coding - Morning lab

## First Activity

1. Find a partner
2. On a whiteboard, pseudo code the process for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. NO COMPUTERS!
3. Start simply with broad commands (put jelly on bread)
4. As time permits, make each broad command more specific (put knife in jelly jar, rotate knife so that it has jelly on it, remove knife)

## Second Activity

1. Swap partners with another group
2. On a whiteboard, pseudo-code a process for going to a restaurant
3. Do some critical thinking about different types of restaurants you've been to. Some are fast food, some are sit down, and some are in between like Barbecue restaurants and food courts. These places have some things in common, like paying for meals, and some things different, like whether a waiter is involved. Alter your code so that it accomodates at least two different types of restaurants.
